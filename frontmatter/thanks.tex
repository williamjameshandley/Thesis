\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I know that I could never have reached this point without the aid of countless individuals. Many apologies if you are unintentionally left out.

First, thanks go to all of my teachers over the past twenty-six years. Special mention goes to those at Alleyn's School: Ed Mann, Anne Poole, Neil Kinner, Sara Hopley, Andy Skinnard and Margaret Hunnibal. At Cambridge I must thank Rafi Blumenfeld, Derek Barnes, Adam Thorne, David Summers, Ulrich Kaiser, Steve Gull, Paul Alexander \& John Ellis. Having experienced teaching from both sides now, I know how difficult a student I must have been, and with that in mind I am especially grateful.

Many thanks are due to the moderators and posters on the various technical fora throughout the internet, particularly on \mbox{\href{http://stackexchange.com/}{StackExchange}}. You are the unsung heroes and hero\"{\i}nes of the modern internet age.

I am very grateful for the kind support of the astrophysics administrator Karen Scrivener. Paul has often said that you are the most important member of the department, and I entirely agree.

To my office mates; Sonke Hee, Richard Wolstenhulme and Do Young Kim for the many amusing, interesting and fruitful conversations over the past few years. 

To Professors Anthony Lasenby and Mike Hobson. One could not wish for more supportive and caring supervisors. I can only hope that one day I will be able to pass the favour on to the next generation of students with half as much skill and grace.

To my mother and father for their endless love and support over the years. 

Last and most to my fianc\'{e}e Sophie Lovick, for her patience and sacrifice.

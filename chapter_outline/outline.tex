\chapter{Outline}
\label{chap:out}

This thesis is divided into two parts. The first details my work on Bayesian inference, and the second in inflationary cosmology.

The first chapter of each part (chapters~\ref{chap:bay} and~\ref{chap:cos}) are introductory, establishing basic theory and notation, as well as my own interpretation of established concepts. The remainder of the thesis is entirely my own work, except where references explicitly state otherwise.

\epigraph{We anticipate the sun will rise tomorrow, not just because it has always done so far, but because this is predicted by {\em models}, which accord with {\em data}. Any perceived failure of the sun to rise would more likely be a hallucination.}{David MacKay}


Science is not the search for truth. Instead, scientists concern themselves with the construction of models which they then determine the relative merits of using data.

% Mathematics -- if then, conditional truth
% Science -- weaker: observations -> possibilities

\section{Probability}
\label{sec:bay:prob}

  We denote the probability of an event $E$, given some initial assumptions $A$ as $\Probc{E}{A}$

    \caption{Beer-mat mathematics. This diagram is how John Skilling explained Bayes' theorem to a young Steve Gull. Out of the entire sample space $\Omega$, if we observe $A$ to be true (blue region), then the probability of $B$ given that we know $A$ is simply $\Prob{A\cap B}/\Prob{A}$. Bayes' theorem then follows by rearrangement and symmetry.}

Science is not the search for truth. Instead, scientists concern themselves with the construction of models. These models have their relative merit determined using data.\footnote{The opening statement of this chapter was in fact the first thing \rafiblumenfeld{} said to us for our part IB Physics supervisions.}

\section{Probability}
\label{sec:bay:prob}

Probability is the mathematical language of uncertainty. It is a methodology of assigning a numerical weighting to outcomes or {\em events}. An event is any subset of the sample space $\Omega$. Some examples of discrete and continuous sample spaces are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The outcome of a coin flip $\Omega_1=\{\mathrm{Heads},\mathrm{Tails}\}$.
  \item The measured position of an electron $\Omega_2=\mathbb{R}$.
\end{enumerate}
For example, an event could be that the electrons position $x$ is measured to be $-1<x<0.5$. The role of probability is to assign a weighting to all subsets, which roughly corresponds to the ``chance'' that such an event would occur. Probability should therefore be additive:
\begin{equation}
  A,B \mathrm{\ disjoint} \Rightarrow \Prob{A \cup B} = \Prob{A} + \Prob{B}.
  \label{eqn:bay:add}
\end{equation}
One also normalises the probability distribution so that $\Prob{\Omega} = 1$. The above is effectively a paraphrasing of Kolmogorov's axioms of probability.

%In addition, if one has two disjoint sample spaces, for example $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ mentioned above, one may combine these into a single samples space ${\Omega=\Omega_1\otimes\Omega_2}$, then probability should be multiplicative.





This entire section may be summarised succinctly and formally as:
\begin{quote}
  Probability is any additive mapping $\mathrm{P}$ from the power set $2^\Omega$ of the sample space $\Omega$ to $[0,1]\in \mathbb{R}$, such that $\Prob{\Omega}=1$.
\end{quote}
\johnskilling{} has derived probability from measurement-theoretical grounds\citep[chap. 1]{Bayesian_methods_in_cosmology}, which provides a more intuitive backing to the definition.



\section{Bayesian vs.\ Frequentist}
\label{sec:bay:bayesian_frequentist}

Whilst the previous section outlined the properties that probability must satisfy, it has not detailed how one should assign probability. Indeed, we have merely referred to probability as a measure of ``chance'', but declined to define what this means.

There are two fundamental types of probability: {\em Aleatoric\/} and {\em Epistemological}. Aleatoric systems are genuinely random, for example: the flip of a coin, or the click on a Geiger counter. Epistemological probability governs systems where the randomness is associated with a subjective lack of knowledge. For example, before prince George was born, bookmakers took bets on whether William and Kate's baby was a boy or a girl. 

The Frequentist school of thought defines probability as:
\begin{description}
  \item[Frequentist Probability:]``The limiting relative frequency of an event.''
\end{description}
I.e.\ if a coin has $\Prob{\mathrm{Head}}=\frac{1}{2}$, then if you were to toss it an arbitrarily large number of times, the fraction of times one would get closer and closer to $\frac{1}{2}$. This is the version of probability that most people encounter early in their mathematical education, but it has several issues.

This definition applies relatively well to Aleatoric systems (since an experiment can often be run a large number of times). However, for epistemological systems, it is all but useless. The frequentist solution is therefore to disregard the latter kind of probability.

Most people's experiences with probability will likely involve betting scenarios, such as William and Kate's baby. Here it is obvious that the betting odds should be approximately $1:1$,\footnote{Betting odds of $a:b$ against indicates a probability of success of $\frac{b}{a+b}$.}\footnote{In fact the probability of a boy being conceived across the population is roughly 51\%, in order to biologically account for male infant mortality. An individual's probability of conceiving a boy or a girl will vary from person to person and in time.}\footnote{A good bookmaker will obviously take this into account, and give you slightly worse odds in order to ensure their profit.} but it should be also be clear that these odds most certainly do not refer to an event that can be repeated an arbitrarily large number of times.

The alternative definition of probability is {\em Bayesian\/}:
\begin{description}
  \item[Bayesian Probability:] ``A degree of belief that an event will occur.'' 
\end{description}
Note that Bayesian probability is {\em subjective}, it matters who's degree of belief one is considering. Probabilities are assigned only with a given state of knowledge. Effectively, Bayesians place aleatoric and epistemological probability under the same umbrella. 

Pure mathematics deals in relative truth or falsity, i.e.\ given initial assumptions, all statements are assigned to the set $\{F,T\}\equiv\{0,1\}$. Bayesian probability can be thought of as a blurring of this process, namely from initial assumptions, various conclusions are assigned a number between $[0,1]$.

Out of the entire sample space $\Omega$, if we observe $A$ to be true (blue region), then the probability of $B$ given that we know $A$ is simply $\Prob{A\cap B}/\Prob{A}$. Bayes' theorem then follows by rearrangement and symmetry.}
\end{figure}


From this definition, it is useful to define conditional probability via:
\begin{equation}
  \Probc{B}{A} = \frac{\Prob{A\cap B}}{\Prob{A}}.
  \label{eqn:bay:cond}
\end{equation}
Multiplying both sides by $\Prob{A}$, and noting the symmetrical alternative:
\begin{equation}
  \Probc{B}{A}\Prob{A} = \Prob{A\cap B} = \Probc{A}{B}\Prob{B},
  \label{eqn:bay:sym}
\end{equation}
one may then derive Bayes' theorem:
\begin{align}
  \Probc{B}{A} &= \frac{\Probc{A}{B}\Prob{B}}{\Prob{A}}.\\
  \label{eqn:bay:bayes}
  \tag{Bayes' Theorem}
\end{align}

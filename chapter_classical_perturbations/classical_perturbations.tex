\section{Recap}
The classical equations of motion for single field inflation are
governed by:
%
\begin{align}
  \dot{H} + H^2 
  &= - \frac{1}{3\m^2}\left( \dot{\phi}^2 - V(\phi)\right)
  \label{eqn:raychaudhuri}
  \\
  0 &= \ddot{\phi} + 3H\dot\phi + V^\prime{\phi}
  \label{eqn:kleingordon}
\end{align}
%
We have proved that if these equations are integrated backward in time
they always begin on a solution in which $\dot\phi^2\gg V(\phi)$
(independent of the potential). This is demonstrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:w}. In this regime, the solutions take the analytical
form:
\begin{equation}
  H = \frac{1}{3t},\qquad \dot{\phi} 
  = \sqrt{\frac 2 3}\frac{\m}{t}, \qquad \phi 
  = \phip \pm \sqrt{\frac 2 3}\m \log\left( \frac t \tp \right)
\end{equation}

The statements above are rigorously true. However, the key question is how physically relevant this observation is, and how this relates to more traditional inflationary set-ups and assumptions.

The classical equations have two opportunities to break down. First, it may be that this kinetically dominated state occurs before the Planck time, when we know that we would need a quantum theory of gravity to describe the universe. Second, it may be that the homogeneity assumption breaks down at early times.

\section{The Planck time}
The Planck epoch occurs at the earliest times and is defined as the
regime in which we are certain we would need a quantum theory of
gravity. Effectively this occurs when:
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \frac{1}{2}\dot\phi^2 + V(\phi)  \sim \m^4
  \label{eqn:rhosim}
\end{equation}
If the universe exits the kinetically dominated solutions before the
Planck time, then kinetic dominance cannot be physically relevant. We
may use this to put bounds on $\phip$, or alternatively the total
number of $e$-folds of inflation.

If we are in the kinetically dominated phase with $\dot{\phi}^2\gg
V(\phi)$ then:
\begin{equation}
              \rho \approx \frac{1}{2}\dot\phi^2= \frac{1\m^2}{3t^2} 
  \label{eqn:rhop}
\end{equation}
so $\rho\sim\m^4$ implies that $t\sim\tp=\m^{-1}$. Thus, in order for
kinetic dominance to be true at the Planck time we require that:
\begin{equation}
  V(\phip) \ll \m^4
\end{equation}
For $\m^2\phi^2$ inflation, this amounts to requiring that $\phip^2\ll
\frac{\m^4}{m^2}$. In order to agree with CMB observations, we require
that $m\sim10^{-5}\m$, which amounts to requiring that:
\begin{equation}
 \phip^2 \ll 10^{10}\m^2 \nonumber.
 \label{eqn:phipbound}
\end{equation}

We may phrase this in terms of the total number of $e$-folds:
\begin{align}
  N_\mathrm{tot} 
  &=\int_{t_\mathrm{begin}}^{t_\mathrm{end}} H dt 
  =\int_{\phi_\mathrm{begin}}^{\phi_\mathrm{end}} 
       \frac{H}{\dot{\phi}}d\phi  &\text{($H=\dot{N}$)}
  \\
  &=\frac{1}{\m^2}\int_{\phi_\mathrm{begin}}^{\phi_\mathrm{end}}
     {\frac{V(\phi)}{V^\prime(\phi)}}d\phi &\text{Slow Roll.}
\end{align}
For $V\sim\phi^n$, this gives:
\begin{equation}
  N = \frac{\Delta (\phi^2) }{n\:\m^2}
\end{equation}
If we take our upper bound (\ref{eqn:phipbound}), and assume that the
end of inflation is somewhere near the base of the potential, we find
that: 
\begin{equation}
  N_\mathrm{tot}\ll 10^{10}.
\end{equation}
It is difficult to imagine how one could possibly constrain the total
number of $e$-folds observationally, unless the number was
sufficiently small so as to be observable directly in the CMB power
spectrum (for example in ``just enough inflation''). There are
theoretical limits, but these typically tend to be much, much larger
than this.

The typical argument (Linde) goes something like this:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We should set initial conditions at the Planck time, when
    $\rho\sim\m^4$.
  \item There will be some partitioning between kinetic and potential
    energy at this moment.
  \item Given that we know nothing of the physics we should put
    uniform priors the amount of energy in the potential at this
    moment: $V(\phip)\in[0,\m^4]$.
  \item Therefore on average we expect equipartition between kinetic
    and potential energy at the Planck time
\end{enumerate}

From Linde's argument, the kinetically dominated regime is only present
after the Planck time for $V(\phip)$ at the very bottom end of the
prior range.

We can see this graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:cls:linde}

The outer circle is the Planck time $\tp$ when $\rho=\m^4$. One can see that each path through phase space is generically drawn to the slow roll attractor solutions in the center of the plot. The lines are plotted so that they have a uniform spacing of kinetic energy at the Planck time.
  The upper plot is somewhat misleading, since it has an artificially high value of $m$. When the value of $m$ is lowered to $0.1\m$, as in the lower plot, then the slow roll phase is a much stronger attractor solution, and generates a sustained slow-roll accelerated expansion.\label{fig:cls:linde}}

\section{Breakdown of homogeneity}
To first order, the $i$-$j$, $i$-$0$ and $0$-$0$ Einstein equations read:
\begin{align}
  \Phi &= \Psi 
  \label{eqn:clp:Eij} \\
  0 &= -\dot{\phi}\:\delta\phi  + 2 H \Phi + 2 \dot{\Phi} 
  \label{eqn:clp:Ei0}\\
  0 &= \left(6H^2-\dot{\phi}^2 + 2\frac{k^2}{a^2}\right)\Phi  + \left( -3H\dot{\phi} - \ddot{\phi} \right)\delta\phi + \dot{\phi}\delta\dot{\phi} +  6 H \dot{\Phi},
  \label{eqn:clp:E00}
\end{align}
where we have absorbed the explicit potential dependence into $\ddot{\phi}$ terms. 
One may rearrange these to gain second order equations in $\Phi$ or $\mathcal{R}$:
\begin{align}
  0 &= \ddot{\Phi} + \left( H - 2 \frac{\ddot{\phi}}{\dot{\phi}} \right) \dot{\Phi} + \left( \frac{k^2}{a^2}-\frac{1}{\m^2}\dot{\phi}^2 - 2\frac{\ddot{\phi}}{\dot{\phi}}H \right)\Phi, \\
  0 &= \ddot{\mathcal{R}} + \left( \frac{\dot{\phi}^2}{\m^2H} + 3H + 2\frac{\ddot{\phi}}{\dot{\phi}} \right)\dot{\mathcal{R}} + \frac{k^2}{a^2}\mathcal{R}, \qquad \mathcal{R} = \Psi - \frac{H}{\dot{\phi}}\delta\phi
\end{align}
There is of course also a second order equation purely in $\delta\phi$, but this is particularly unappetising, and given that we have an explicit solution for it in~\eqref{eqn:clp:Ei0}, we shall not state it here.
Technically, these equations are derived in the Newtonian gauge ($E=B=0$), but since everything here is manifestly gauge invariant one may interpret all of the above equations as the relations in the equivalent gauge invariant variables.

If we apply the kinetically dominated solutions to the background variables, we arrive at:
\begin{align}
  0 &= \ddot{\Phi} + \frac{7}{3}\frac{1}{t}\dot{\Phi} + \frac{k^2}{a^2} \Phi,\\
  0 &= \ddot{\mathcal{R}} + \frac{1}{t}\dot{\mathcal{R}} + \frac{k^2}{a^2} \mathcal{R},\\
  a &\propto t^{1/3}
\end{align}

Both equations are of the form:
\begin{align}
  0 &=\ddot{x} + (1+p)\frac{1}{t}\dot{x} + \frac{k^2}{a^2} x  \\
  \Rightarrow \qquad
  x &= t^{-\frac{p}{2}}\left[ A J_{\frac{3}{4}p}\left( \frac{3k}{2a} t \right) + B Y_{\frac{3}{4}p}\left( \frac{3k}{2a} t \right) \right] \\
  &\sim  t^{-\frac{p}{2}-\frac{1}{3}}, \qquad t \gg 1
\end{align}
So the solutions are generically oscillatory with a polynomial decay with inverse power $\frac{p}{2} + \frac{1}{3}$.

Physically that means that as we integrate further backwards in time, although the homogeneous universe is drawn toward a kinetically dominated state, spatial inhomogeneities begin to increase.

What this means, is that if some portion of the universe at an early stage has $\dot{\phi}^2 \gg V(\phi)$, and is approximately homogeneous, then the comoving size of that portion will grow, and kinetic dominance causes patches of the universe to homogenise.

The two parts of this thesis, namely cosmology and numerical methods are already linked. Requirements provided by the need to analyse theory and observation have created the need to construct new numerical approaches to solving the early universe. Further, the creation of these approaches has already opened up new avenues of research in cosmology and astrophysics as a whole, many of which are only beginning to be explored.

I anticipate that in the future, this interplay between theory, observation and methods will continue to complement each other within my research into the field of cosmology and beyond.

To Professors Anthony Lasenby and Mike Hobson. One could not hope for more supportive and caring supervisors. I can only hope that one day I will be able to pass the favour to the next generation of students with half as much skill and grace.

Thanks are due to all of my teachers over the past twenty-six years. Special mention goes to my Mathematics and Science teachers at Alleyn's School: Ed Mann, Anne Poole, Neil Kinner, Sara Hopley and Margaret Hunnibal. At Cambridge I must thank Rafi Blumenfeld, Derek Barnes, Adam Thorne, David Summers, Ulrich Kaiser, Steve Gull, Paul Alexander \& John Ellis. Having experienced supervising from both sides now, I know how difficult a student I must have been.

I am very grateful to have the support and care of the astrophysics administrator Karen Scrivener. 

To my office mates Sonke Hee, Richard Wolstenhulme and Do Young,

To my mother and father for all of their love and support over the years.

Last and most to my fianc\'{e}e

%Many thanks are due to the moderators and posters on the \mbox{\href{http://stackexchange.com/}{StackExchange}} forums. You are the unsung heroes and heroines of the modern internet age.
